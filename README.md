# MB-Racing-System
Version 1.0

Hello everyone 
I was free so i decided to make racing system that is easy to use for all in Dm / Tdm / Rp.
Well i'll tell how you can use that racing system.

First you need to be rcon admin to use this filterscript cmds.

I added several cmds to make it easy and better. 

/rcmds to watch all race filterscipt cmds.

/createrace to create your own race by just pressing mouse Left key (Key Fire)

/enableraceevent use this cmd when you created all 14 checkpoints this will enable that race checkpoints for all and they can join race.

/startrace will start the race for all the player who join the race event.

/endrace cmd for rcon admin he can only end the race.

/joinrace  teleport you to race position if race is active and you can chose car from given car menu.

/leaverace if you want to leave race.
